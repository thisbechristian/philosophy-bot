Sometimes life feels like trying to paddle upstream against a strong current. There's an old idea, from a book called the <b>Tao Te Ching</b>, that might help shift your perspective. It says:</p><blockquote><p><i>'Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.'</i></p></blockquote><p>What this means is that there's a natural rhythm to things. Think about a plant growing. It doesn’t try to force itself to bloom overnight. It just grows, steadily and surely, according to its own pace.  <b>You too</b> can find this natural flow in your own life.</p><h2>How can this help you?</h2><p>This idea reminds us to:</p><ul><li><b>Let go of the need to control everything:</b> Relax and trust the process. Things will unfold in their own time.</li><li><b>Focus on what you can influence:</b> Direct your energy towards your own actions, thoughts, and choices, instead of worrying about things outside of your control.</li><li><b>Be patient with yourself:</b> Growth and progress take time. Don't rush or compare yourself to others.</li></ul><p>Instead of pushing and struggling, try to be more like water, <i>flexible and adaptable</i>. Find your flow and you'll be surprised at what you can achieve without the need to constantly struggle.

Hinduism, extensively explored in the <b>Bhagavad Gita</b>, explains this through the concept of the <b>Three Gunas</b>: Sattva (goodness, purity, harmony), Rajas (passion, activity, ambition), and Tamas (inertia, darkness, ignorance).
